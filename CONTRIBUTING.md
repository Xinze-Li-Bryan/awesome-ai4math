## Guidelines

### Adding a Resource

Please ensure your pull request adheres to these guidelines:

- **Search first** - Check that the resource hasn't been added before
- **One resource per PR** - Make a separate pull request for each suggestion
- **Use the format** - `[Name](link) - Brief description`
- **Keep it short** - Description should be one sentence, no period at the end
- **Alphabetize** - Add entries in alphabetical order within their section
- **Check your links** - Make sure URLs are valid and point to the right place

### Format Example

```markdown
- [Lean 4](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4) - Functional programming language and theorem prover
```
